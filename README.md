Implemented the Google Maps API and an external Rental Property API to allow users to earch for rental properties and display that search data on a Google Map. Allows users to click on property markers to display more information regarding that specific property. I also created complex scroll animations using GSAP.

Use the explore page to search for properties. If the search criteria is valid, the implemented Google Map will automatically pan and zoom to the search location and display markers where the properties are located. The user can click on these markers in order to display a photo and basic information regarding the property.

Below in the results panel more information is displayed, and a "show on map" button will display that specific property on the Google Map when clicked.
